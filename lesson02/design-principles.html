            <p>Github is a website that is used to store code that can be made public and is often used for collaborative
                projects. This homepage has 2 main sections: the top section that has your personal repositories and teams
                and the second section that contains a feed of all activity of repositories you follow. The contaning boxes
                in each section are aligned with each other to help show that they are connected.

            <p>Reddit is a massive forumn based website used for almost every purpose under the sun, and over. 
                This site has related objects in close proximity with one another helping the users comprehension
                for what each thing is for. For example all of the login/signup/account information is located in the 
                top right corner. The popular/trending threads are next to each other near the top, and various suggested
                forumn posts are on top of one another farther down.

            <img src="images/ContrastEx.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the D&D Beyond Website homepage">
            <p>D&D Beyond is a very well done website that caters to those who play D&D. There are 4 links located
                at the top and they are designed to look like white boxes with colored text and transparent images.
                Those colors provide a stark contrast to the dark background which along with the shadows show the 
                user that these are designed as links or buttons to take you elsewhere on the website.
